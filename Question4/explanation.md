Here are the mandatory explanations for the Question 4 tasks to include in your repository:

System Uptime: I used this command to determine how long the system has been active and to check the current system load averages.

User Processes: I generated a list of all active processes currently running under my specific user ID to monitor account activity.

Resource Usage: I accessed the real-time system monitor to identify which processes are consuming the most CPU and memory resources.

Background Job: I initiated a task with the ampersand operator to demonstrate how to run commands in the background while keeping the terminal free.

Priority Management: I adjusted the scheduling priority of a running process using its PID to change its resource allocation.

Memory Status: I displayed the total, used, and available RAM in a human-readable format to check for memory bottlenecks.

Partition Usage: I checked the disk space usage of the current partition to ensure there is enough room for system operations.

Current Shell: I echoed the environment variable to identify exactly which shell interface is being used for this session.

Generate Report: I redirected the output of the CPU architecture details into a text file to create a permanent hardware report.

Visual Disk Usage: I attempted to use a visual disk analyzer to navigate through my directory structure and identify large folders.
