Project Workspace: I created a directory named "documents" to serve as a dedicated space for project files.

File Creation: I navigated into the new folder and initialized an empty file named plan.txt.

Content Addition: I used the nano editor to add sample text to the plan file.

Metadata Verification: I checked the file details to confirm my ownership and current permissions.

File Duplication: I made a copy of the plan file to ensure I had a backup before further changes.

Directory Renaming: I renamed the workspace to "project_documents" to better reflect the folder's scope.

Archival Structure: I created an "archive" subdirectory to practice hierarchical file organization.

File Organization: I moved the duplicate file into the archive folder to clear the main workspace.

Recursive Listing: I used the -R flag to visualize the entire tree structure of my project folder.

Path Verification: I displayed the absolute path to confirm the final location of the archived file.
